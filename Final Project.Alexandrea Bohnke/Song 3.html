<p>
    Look at this stuff
    Isn't it neat?
    Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
    Wouldn't you think I'm the girl
    The girl who has ev'rything?
    Look at this trove
    Treasures untold
    How many wonders can one cavern hold?
    Lookin' around here you'd think
    (Sure) she's got everything3

    I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty
    I've got whozits and whatzits galore
    (You want thingamabobs?
    I got twenty)
    But who cares?
    No big deal
    I want more3

    I want to be where the people are
    I want to see
    want to see 'em dancin'
    Walkin' around on those
    (Whad'ya call 'em?) oh - feet
    Flippin' your fins you don't get too far
    Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
    Strollin' along down a
    (What's that word again?) street

    Up where they walk
    Up where they run
    Up where they stay all day in the sun
    Wanderin' free
    Wish I could be
    Part of that world

    What would I give
    If I could live
    Outta these waters?
    What would I pay
    To spend a day
    Warm on the sand?
    Betcha on land
    They understand
    Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
    Bright young women
    Sick o' swimmin'
    Ready to stand1

    And ready to know what the people know
    Ask 'em my questions
    And get some answers
    What's a fire and why does it
    (What's the word?) burn?

    When's it my turn?
    Wouldn't I love
    Love to explore that shore above?
    Out of the sea
    Wish I could be
    Part of that world
