    [Hook Hand Thug:]
    I'm malicious, mean and scary
    My sneer could curdle dairy
    And violence-wise, my hands are not the cleanest
    But despite my evil look
    And my temper, and my hook
    I've always yearned to be a concert pianist
    Can'tcha see me on the stage performin' Mozart?
    Tickling the ivories 'til they gleam?
    Yep, I'd rather be called deadly
    For my killer show-tune medley
    Thank you!
    'Cause way down deep inside
    I've got a dream

    [Thug Chorus:]
    He's got a dream!
    He's got a dream!

    [Hook Hand Thug:]
    See, I ain't as cruel and vicious as I seem!
    Though I do like breaking femurs
    You can count me with the dreamers
    Like everybody else
    I've got a dream!

    [Big Nose Thug:]
    I've got scars and lumps and bruises
    Plus something here that oozes
    And let's not even mention my complexion
    But despite my extra toes
    And my goiter, and my nose
    I really want to make a love connection
    Can't you see me with a special little lady
    Rowin' in a rowboat down the stream?
    Though I'm one disgusting blighter
    I'm a lover, not a fighter --
    'Cause way down deep inside
    I've got a dream
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    He's got a dream!

    [Big Nose Thug:]
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    He's got a dream!

    [Big Nose Thug:]
    And I know one day romance will reign supreme!
    Though my face leaves people screaming
    There's a child behind it, dreaming --
    Like everybody else
    I've got a dream

    [Thug Chorus:]
    Tor would like to quit and be a florist
    Gunther does interior design
    Ulf is into mime
    Attila's cupcakes are sublime
    Bruiser knits
    Killer sews
    Fang does little puppet shows

    [Hook Hand Thug:]
    And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns!

    [Flynn:]
    I have dreams, like you -- no, really!
    Just much less touchy-feely
    They mainly happen somewhere
    warm and sunny
    On an island that I own
    Tanned and rested and alone
    Surrounded by enormous piles of money

    [Rapunzel:]
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    She's got a dream!

    [Rapunzel:]
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    She's got a dream!

    [Rapunzel:]
    I just want to see the floating
    lanterns gleam!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    Yeahh!

    [Rapunzel:]
    And with every passing hour
    I'm so glad I left my tower --
    Like all you lovely folks
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    She's got a dream!
    He's got a dream!
    They've got a dream!
    We've got a dream!
    So our diff 'rences ain't
    really that extreme!
    We're one big team...!
    Call us brutal --
    Sick --

    [Hook Hand Thug:]
    Sadistic --

    [Big Nose Thug:]
    And grotesquely optimistic

    [Thug Chorus:]
    'Cause way down deep inside
    We've got a dream!

    [Hook Hand Thug:]
    I've got a dream!

    [Big Nose Thug:]
    I've got a dream!

    [Thug Chorus:]
    I've got a dream!
    I've got a dream!
    I've got a dream!

    [Rapunzel:]
    I've got a dream!

    [All:]
    Yes way down deep
    inside, I've got a dream!
    Yeahh!
